# C File System Simulator

This project is a basic file system simulator written in C. It demonstrates the internal structure and operations of a file system, including file and directory creation, inode management, block allocation, and bitmap management. The goal of this project is to simulate the core components of a file system at a low level.

## Features

- **Block Allocation**: Simulates the allocation of storage blocks.
- **Inode Table**: Manages inodes for files and directories.
- **Bitmap**: Tracks allocated and unallocated blocks.
- **Directory Management**: Simulates creation of directories within the file system.
- **Binary File Storage**: Uses a binary file to represent the file system's storage.
